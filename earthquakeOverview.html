        <h2> Brief Background </h2>
        <p>
            The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, when it is combined with the uppermost portion of the mantle (the next layer inwards), the two form the Lithosphere which is “the coolest and most rigid part of the Earth”(Sue, 2015).  Tectonic activity originates from the lithosphere, and it can lead to instantly noticeable events on the surface such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, or much slower processes that can reshape landscapes such as volcano formation, mountain building(orogeny), and the formation of deep ocean trenches (Sue, 2015).  The lithosphere is not one continuous piece that encapsulates the inner layers of Earth, rather, it is an amalgamation of  “about 20 tectonic plates that move in different directions”(Earle, 2015).  In the Earth’s crust, there are cracks known as faults, which are caused by the constant motion of the tectonic plates below the crust.  An earthquake occurs when the tectonic plates below a fault shift and cause “sudden movement at a fault line”(Sue, 2015).  The epicenter of an earthquake is its point of origin, and it is areas near this epicenter that feel the earthquake the most (BBC, n.d.).

        <h2> Short-Term Effects </h2>
        <p>
            The initial effects of an earthquake can be catastrophic, or very minimal depending on various conditions.  The minimal effects of earthquakes can’t be felt by most people, if its intensity is low enough, meaning that only specific instruments called seismometers can detect them (BBC, n.d.).  On the catastrophic end of the spectrum there is a great possibility of the destruction of large structures, such as buildings, tunnels, and bridges due to the intensity of the Earth’s shaking.  The collapse of these buildings is deadly and chaotic in terms of kinetic and potential force, as well as “secondhand” consequences, such as the exposure of raw electrical components or broken gas lines, which have the potential to turn fallen buildings into blazing infernos.  Along with the destruction of structures, the shaking of Earth can lead to sturdy portions of water-saturated sediment being agitated to the point that the individual grains shift such that the water holding them together contributes to their separation, allowing for the flow of sediment, this is known as liquefaction (Earle, 2015).  After the initial earthquake, there is also the possibility of “aftershocks” which are less intense periods of shaking from the earth, they certainly carry the potential to increase the damage done by the initial strike.

          <h2>Long-Term Effects</h2>
          <p>
            There are many effects of an earthquake, the immediate ones are the most obvious, but the long-term impact can be much more devastating, under various circumstances.  Essential infrastructure can be decimated by an earthquake, not only becoming unavailable, but also adding to the disaster of such a situation.  Sewage lines can be ruptured, spewing biohazardous waste into any flooding or soil liquefaction that has occurred, it can become very difficult to avoid contact in the pandemonium of such a disaster.  This, along with the loss of high quality sanitation and the close quarters living of mass housing or refugee camps can lead to rapid disease spread (BBC, n.d.).  From an economic perspective, a major earthquake would be costly to any nation, but those with smaller GDP and less stable political systems are at a large risk of long lasting devastation.  The initial impacts of an earthquake could halt a great deal of economic activity, domestically and internationally which for less wealthy nations could be disastrous, as time goes on however, the extent of the impact can worsen (BBC, n.d.).  The cost of cleaning and rebuilding major urban centers could be too much to bear for some nations, or political corruption could prevent aid from reaching those who need it most.

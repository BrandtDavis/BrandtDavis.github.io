        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>
          The tracking of earthquakes in Canada is a highly involved undertaking, The Canadian National Seismograph Network is made up of about 100 seismographs and operated by the Geological Survey of Canada (Berry, 2015).  In addition to the seismographs, the Geological Survey of Canada(GSC) is responsible for the operation of over 60 accelerographs (NRCAN, 2018).  Seismographs are also known as “high-gain instruments” and their main usage is to record the weak ground motion caused by earthquakes, typically these earthquakes are small and/or distant (NRCAN, 2018).  The accelerographs are known as low gain/strong motion seismographs and they record “strong ground shaking from larger earthquakes at nearby sites likely to cause damage”(NRCAN, 2018).

        <h2>How the Data is Used</h2>
        <p>
          The Canadian National Seismograph Network(CNSN) produces a constant stream of data to be collected and analyzed nearly in real time, which leads to the automatic detection of potential earthquakes from their signals, this is done by each station (NRCAN, 2019).  While still helpful, the automatic detection mechanisms are not to be completely trusted at first glance, and they do require a knowledgeable and experienced individual to analyze the data for more accurate results (NRCAN, 2019).  Despite requiring expert analysis, these instruments lower response times to earthquakes that are felt and/or likely to cause harm by a considerable margin, they allow for information to reach the public more quickly as well as inform the emergency response community with appropriate promptness (NRCAN, 2019).  Another important use of the data captured by the CNSN is in research.  The properties of earthquakes can be studied using the excellent information obtained by the various instruments in the network, and in conjunction with data pertaining to the spread, frequency, and proportions of geological activity can be used to update and enhance the National Building Code’s “earthquake-resistance provisions” (NRCAN, 2019).

          <h2>Seismographs</h2>
          <p>
            A seismograph is an instrument that measures the vibrations caused by rocks breaking along a fault zone that travel outwards during earthquakes (NRCAN, 2019).  In the past, these instruments contained a seismometer or “sensing element”, an amplifier, and often photographic or heat-sensitive paper known as the “hardcopy display unit” (NRCAN, 2019).  These instruments produce a visual record of activity that is called a seismogram (NRCAN, 2019).  In more recent times, digital methods have been implemented to aid in improving the presentation and transmission of data, for example, the display unit can be augmented, or totally swapped out with a digitizer (NRCAN, 2019).  The storage of data has been updated to use digital storage technologies (hard drives, etc.) with the instrument, or if this method isn’t used, the data can be transmitted with a telemetry system using the internet, telephone lines, or radio (NRCAN, 2019).

          <h2>seismometers</h2>
          <p>
            Also known as a sensing element, seismometers are used to measure the movement caused by an earthquake.  In order to measure the movement of the ground, the motion itself is “measured against something that remains relatively fixed”(Natural Resources Canada[NRCAN], 2019), traditionally, in a seismometer, this is a “mass suspended on springs within a case”(NRCAN, 2019).  In the midst of an earthquake, it will be the case itself that moves with the ground, while the suspended mass stays relatively motionless.  More recent models of seismometers utilize electromagnetism, in which the mass is a large magnet that remains fixed and “the outside case contains numerous windings of fine wire”(NRCAN, 2019).   These windings of fine wire are immensely important, as “movements of the case relative to the magnet generate small electric signals in the wire coil” (NRCAN, 2019).

          <h2>accelerographs</h2>
          <p>
            Otherwise known as “strong seismographs” these instruments are only about the size of a shoebox with the capability of measuring information of “very strong ground motions” which is typically in excess of what high-gain seismographs are capable of measuring (NRCAN, 2018).   They are named accelerographs because the ground’s acceleration is what they measure, and in order to get a complete understanding of the ground’s movement, the shaking of the earth must be measured vertically on one axis, and then horizontally on two axes, or three perpendicular directions (NRCAN, 2018).   Accelerographs have become a very important tool for engineers to design structures that are more resistant to earthquakes (NRCAN, 2018).

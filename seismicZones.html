        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>
          According to Earthquakes Canada, an operation within the Department of National Resources Canada, there are 6 major seismic zones known as the Offshore Region, Cascadia Subduction Zone, St. Elias Region and the Southwestern Yukon Territory, Northern Cordillera, Southern Cordillera, and Interior Platform (NRCAN, 2018).  Several of these zones will be discussed.

        <h2> Offshore Region </h2>
        <p>
          The Pacific plate slides northwest at a rate of roughly 6cm/year with respect to the North American plate, this occurs from the northern portion of Vancouver Island to the Queen Charlotte Islands, and the boundary between the two massive plates is known as the Queen Charlotte fault (this is the Canadian version of the San Andreas fault) (NRCAN, 2018).  This comparison of the Queen Charlotte fault with such an infamous boundary as the San Andreas fault is aptly made, as the largest historical earthquake to occur in Canada was along this fault on August 22, 1949, with a staggering magnitude of 8.1 (NRCAN, 2018).

        <h2>Cascadia Subduction Zone</h2>
        <p>
          The Juan de Duca plate is an oceanic plate that moves closer to the North American plate at a rate of about 2-5 cm/year, and from the area west of Vancouver Island to the northernmost point of the Island to northern California is known as the Cascadia subduction zone.  The oceanic Juan de Fuca plate is much smaller than the continental North American plate, and it is subducting (sliding) beneath the continent, currently it is roughly 70 km below Vancouver and about 45 km beneath Victoria (NRCAN, 2018).  There is currently accepted evidence that the Juan de Fuca plate is not always in motion due to it and the North American plate being locked together, which is causing the Earth’s crust to accumulate strain, which is essentially the crust being squeezed (NRCAN, 2018).  This squeezing of the crust is what causes the annual (roughly) 300 small earthquakes of southwestern BC, along with the less common, but more damaging crustal earthquakes that occur on average, every decade or so, such as the magnitude 7.3 earthquake in 1946 that struck on the central portion of Vancouver Island(NRCAN, 2018).  It is predicted that in the future at some point, the two plates will break loose from each other and cause massive offshore “subduction” earthquake, which may be similar to a magnitude 9.2 earthquake that occurred in Alaska during 1964, there is also geological evidence that a massive subduction earthquake happens every 300-800 years on this coast (NRCAN, 2018).

       <h2>St. Elias Region and the Southwestern Yukon Territory</h2>
       <p>
        Consisting of the southwest Yukon Territory, Northern BC, and southeast Alaska, this zone is considered to be one of the most seismically active areas in all of Canada (NRCAN, 2018).  It is in this region that the Pacific and North American plate boundary lies, and the current state of the changing boundary is that they are sliding past each other, also known as a transform (NRCAN, 2018).  Although, it is changing such that the Pacific plate’s movement is being forced underneath the Aleutian Islands, this is known as subduction (NRCAN, 2018).  This change from transform to subduction contributes to a rather rapid rate of mountain building known as uplift, the rate in this area can be as high as 30mm/year (NRCAN, 2018).  There have been many significant earthquakes along the plate boundary, for instance, in the year 1899 there were three earthquakes ranging in magnitude from 7.4 to 8.0 (NRCAN, 2018).   Another example of significant seismic activity is a magnitude 7.9  earthquake struck along the northern extension of the Queen Charlotte transform fault (known as the Fairweather fault), in 1958 (NRCAN, 2018).  In the southwest Yukon, there is the Denali fault zone, which has segments in the Dalton and Duke rivers, this is the inland zone with the most significant seismic activity(NRCAN, 2018).
